# 🚀 Enterprise Vendor Risk Management (GRC) Framework

**A complete, end-to-end simulation of an enterprise Third-Party Risk Management (TPRM) program, including automated risk registers, dashboards, governance artifacts, and compliance alignment with ISO 27001 & NIST CSF.**  

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This repository demonstrates a **real-world Vendor Risk Management program**, showcasing how risk is designed, assessed, and operationalized across an organization.  

It includes:

- **Framework Design (Deliverable 1):** Enterprise-aligned vendor risk policies & methodology  
- **Vendor Risk Assessment (Deliverable 2):** Structured questionnaires & scoring logic  
- **Automated Risk Register (Deliverable 3):** Inherent → Control → Residual risk with Excel automation  
- **Risk Acceptance & Governance (Deliverable 4):** RACI accountability, SLA monitoring, and overdue alerts  
- **Executive Dashboard (Deliverable 5):** Visualized high-risk vendors, evidence gaps, and audit readiness  

> This project is designed to **mirror real enterprise GRC operations**, not just academic exercises.
